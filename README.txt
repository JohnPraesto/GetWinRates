What is your win chanses in a 1v1 competition?

Setting points to properties we can see the win chance of each property
and of each individual participating in the competition.

-----------------

For example. Lets say we have a ping pong competiton.

The participants have an age above or below 40.
We set above 40 to be worth 300 points and below to 500.

The participants have ping pong experience of
<1 year (100 points), 1-3 years (600), and >3 years(700).

And finally let's set points for hours of sleep.
<5 h (145), 5-7h (330), >7h (400).

After setting all points, the individuals are created in the program.
The individuals are made up of all combinations of properties.
The number of individuals are 2x3x3=18, ranging from
Age above 40, <1 years experience, <5h of sleep = 300+100+145=545 points
to
Age below 40, >3 years of experience, >7h sleep = 500+700+400=1600 points

Now some math in the program takes place but basically it calculates each
individuals chance of winning against an average opponent.

The property win chances calculates the average
win rate of all indviduals carrying that property.

The colors, shapes, and patterns are subsitutes for any property you want.
